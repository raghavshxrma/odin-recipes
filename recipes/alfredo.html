        Fettuccine Alfredo or fettuccine al burro is an Italian pasta dish of
        fresh fettuccine tossed with butter and Parmesan. As the cheese melts,
        it emulsifies the liquids to form a smooth and rich cheese sauce coating
        the pasta.

      <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Spray the crock of a slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray. Place
          chicken breasts in the crock. Combine water and Italian dressing mix
          in a small bowl. Pour over chicken; sprinkle with garlic, cover, and
          cook on Low for 4 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          After 4 hours, whisk cream cheese and condensed soup together in a
          bowl. Pour over chicken. Stir in mushrooms. Cover and cook on Low for
          1 hour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil
          over high heat. Stir in spaghetti, and return to a boil. Cook pasta
          uncovered, stirring occasionally, until cooked through but still firm
          to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain well.
        </li>
        <li>
          To serve, spoon chicken and sauce over hot cooked pasta and sprinkle
          with parsley.
